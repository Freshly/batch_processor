## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'batch_processor'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install batch_processor

## Getting Started

BatchProcessor comes with some nice rails generators. You are encouraged to use them!

```bash
$ rails g batch_processor foo
  invoke  rspec
  create    spec/batches/foo_batch_spec.rb
  create  app/batches/foo_batch.rb
```

## What is BatchProcessor?

BatchProcessor is a framework for the sequential or parallel processing of jobs in Ruby on Rails.

BatchProcessor helps monitor, control, and orchestrate the work done by `ActiveJob`.

üíÅ‚Äç This requires [Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis-rb) and a properly configured `ActiveJob` queue adapter (like [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq)).

## How It Works

![BatchProcessor](docs/images/batch_processor.png)

There are three key concepts to distinguish here: [Batches](#Batches), [Processors](#Processors), and [Jobs](#Jobs).

### Batches

A **Batch** defines, controls, and monitors the processing of a collection of items with an `ActiveJob`.

All Batches should be named with the `Batch` suffix (ex: `FooBatch`).

```ruby
class PodSprintCalculationBatch < ApplicationBatch
  set_callback(:batch_started, :before) { raise CalculationsNotRunning unless Calculator.busy? }

  on_batch_finished { Calculator.done! }

  class Collection < BatchCollection
    argument :sprint, allow_nil: false
    option :recalculate, default: false

    def items
      recalculate ? items_for_recalculation : items_for_calculation
    end

    def items_for_calculation
      items_for_recalculation.without_performance_metrics
    end

    def items_for_recalculation
      sprint.pod_sprints.with_performance_plans
    end
  end
end
```

A batch is a synthesis of four concepts: a [Collection](#Collection), an [ActiveJob](#ActiveJob), granular [Details](#Details), a summary [Status](#Status), and some [Callbacks](#Callbacks).

#### Collection

A `Collection` takes input to validate and build a (possibly ordered) list of items to process with the Batch's job.

Batches accept a unique identifier and input representing the arguments and options which define it's collection.

```ruby
batch_id = SecureRandom.hex
PodSprintCalculationBatch.process(batch_id: batch_id, sprint: Sprint.last)
```

You can supply any unique value you want for a `batch_id`:

```ruby
attempt_number = 1
current_date = Date.today
batch_id = "daily-charge-batch:#{current_date}:#{attempt_number}"

ChargeBatch.process(batch_id: batch_id, date: current_date)
```

Which you can then pass to `ApplicationBatch.find` to load:

```ruby
batch = ApplicationBatch.find("daily-charge-batch:#{Date.today}:1")
batch.class.name # => ChargeBatch
batch.batch_id # => "daily-charge-batch:2019-07-25:1"
```

If you do not specify a `batch_id` one will be randomly generated.

```ruby
batch = ChargeBatch.process(date: Date.today)
batch.batch_id # => XP-f-G23bNFwww
```

##### Input

A collection accepts input represented by arguments and options which initialize it.

Arguments describe input required to define the initial state.

If any arguments are missing, an ArgumentError is raised.

```ruby
class ExampleJob < BatchProcessor::BatchJob
  def perform(arg)
    "OK #{arg}"
  end
end

class ExampleBatch < ApplicationBatch
  class Collection < BatchCollection
    argument :foo
    argument :bar
    
    def items
      [ foo, bar ]
    end
  end
end

ExampleBatch.process # => ArgumentError (Missing arguments: foo, bar)
ExampleBatch.process(foo: "foo") # => ArgumentError (Missing argument: bar)
ExampleBatch.process(foo: "foo", bar: "bar") # => #<ExampleBatch batch_id="XPf--GzdbRLyww">
```

By default, nil is a valid argument:

```ruby
ExampleBatch.process(foo: nil, bar: nil) # => #<ExampleBatch batch_id="f-GzXP-dbn3yxw">
```

If you want to require a non-nil value for your argument, set the allow_nil option (true by default):

```ruby
class ExampleBatch < ApplicationBatch
  class Collection < BatchCollection
    argument :foo
    argument :bar, allow_nil: false
    
    def items
      [ foo, bar ]
    end
  end
end

ExampleBatch.process(foo: nil, bar: nil) # => ArgumentError (Missing argument: bar)
```

Options describe input which may be provided to define or override the initial state.

Options can optionally define a default value.

If no default is specified, the value will be nil.

If the default value is static, it can be specified in the class definition.

If the default value is dynamic, you may provide a block to compute the default value.

‚ö†Ô∏è‚Äç Heads Up: The default value blocks DO NOT provide access to the state or its other variables!

```ruby
class ExampleBatch < ApplicationBatch
  class Collection < BatchCollection
    option :attribution_source
    option :favorite_foods, default: %w[pizza ice_cream gluten]
    option(:favorite_color) { SecureRandom.hex(3) }
    
    def items
      [ attribution_source, favorite_foods, favorite_color ]
    end
  end
end

batch = ExampleBatch.process(favorite_foods: %w[avocado hummus nutritional_yeast])
collection = batch.collection

collection.attribution_source # => nil
collection.favorite_color # => "1a1f1e"
collection.favorite_foods # => ["avocado", "hummus" ,"nutritional_yeast"]
```

##### Validations

Collections are `ActiveModels` which means they have access to [ActiveModel::Validations](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/Validations.html).

It is considered a best practice to write validations in your collections.

Batches which have an invalid collection will NOT start and therefore will not process any Jobs, so it is inherently the safest and clearest way to proactively communicate about missed expectations.

üíÅ‚Äç Pro Tip: There is a `process!` method on Batches that will raise any errors (which are normally silenced). Invalid states are one such example!

```ruby
class ExampleBatch < ApplicationBatch
  class Collection < BatchCollection
    argument :first_name
  
    validates :first_name, length: { minimum: 2 }
    
    def items
      [ first_name ]
    end
  end
end

ExampleBatch.process!(first_name: "a") # => raises BatchProcessor::CollectionInvalidError

batch = ExampleBatch.process(first_name: "a")
batch.started? # => false
batch.collection_valid? # => false
batch.collection.errors.messages # => {:first_name=>["is too short (minimum is 2 characters)"]}
```

#### ActiveJob

When `.process` is called on a Batch, `.execute` is called on the `Processor` specified in the Batch's definition.

Unless otherwise specified a **Batch** assumes its Job class shares a common name.

Ex: `FooBarBazBatch` assumes there is a defined `FooBarBazJob`.

If you want to customize this behavior, define the job class explicitly:

```ruby
class ExampleBatch < ApplicationBatch
  process_with_job SomeOtherJob
end
```

##### Retries

TODO

üí° **Note**: Failure is only triggered after all retries are exhausted for the job.

#### Details

The **Details** of a batch are the times of critical lifecycle events and the summary counts of processed jobs.

```ruby
batch = ExampleBatch.process
details = batch.details

details.started_at # => 2019-07-25 12:13:44 UTC
details.size # => 1
details.pending_jobs_count # => 1
details.to_h # => {"class_name"=>"ExampleBatch", "started_at"=>"2019-07-25 08:13:44 -0400", "size"=>"1", "pending_jobs_count"=>"1"}
```

The details object is built with [RedisHash](https://github.com/Freshly/spicerack/tree/master/redis_hash) which works just like a plain old ruby Hash which makes calls to fetch data automatically.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This hash is **NOT** cached so each method call makes a `Redis` call! `#FeatureNotABug`

```ruby
batch = ExampleBatch.process
details = batch.details

details.pending_jobs_count # => 3

# rake resque:work in another window...

details.pending_jobs_count # => 2
details.pending_jobs_count # => 1
```

```ruby
batch = ExampleBatch.process
batch.started? # => true
batch.enqueued? # => false
batch.aborted? # => false
batch.finished? # => true

batch.enqueued_jobs? # => false
batch.finished_jobs? # => true
```

| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| started?          | True if `started_at` is defined for the batch.  |
| enqueued?         | True if `enqueued_at` is defined for the batch. |

| processing?       | True if started, unfinished, and not aborted.   |

#### Callbacks

Batches have a status which is driven by the jobs it is processing. Callbacks are fired in response to status changes.

```ruby
class ExampleBatch < ApplicationBatch
  class Collection < BatchCollection
    def items
      [ SecureRandom.hex ]
    end
  end
  
  on_batch_started { SlackClient.send_message("Batch started!") }
  on_batch_finished { SlackClient.send_message("Batch finished!") }
  
  on_batch_aborted :handle_batch_aborted, unless: -> { Business.during_business_hours? }
  on_batch_cleared :handle_batch_cleared, if: :important?
  
  def important?
    batch_id.include?("vip")
  end
  
  def handle_batch_aborted
    EmailClient.send_email("management@business.engineering", "Unexpected batch abort!", batch_id)
  end
  
  def handle_batch_cleared
    EmailClient.send_email("developers@business.engineering", "Crazy stuff happened!", details.to_h)
  end
end
```

##### Callback Methods

| Name              | Triggered when...                                   |

| on_job_canceled   | A batch job skips perform after a batch is aborted. |

### Processors

A **Processor** is a service object which determines how to perform a Batch's jobs to properly process its collection.

Unless otherwise specified a **Batch** uses the `default` **Parallel** Processor.

```ruby
class DefaultBatch < ApplicationBatch; end
DefaultBatch.processor_class # => BatchProcessor::Processors::Parallel

class ExampleBatch < ApplicationBatch
  with_sequential_processor
end
ExampleBatch.processor_class # => BatchProcessor::Processors::Sequential

class OtherBatch < ApplicationBatch
  with_parallel_processor
end
OtherBatch.processor_class # => BatchProcessor::Processors::Parallel
```

The default processors can be redefined and new [custom processors](#custom-processors) can be added as well.

Create a `config/initializers/batch_processor.rb` to define these:

```ruby
# Make sequential processor the default
ApplicationBatch::PROCESSOR_CLASS_BY_STRATEGY[:default] = BatchProcessor::Processors::Sequential
```

Certain processors have configurable options; this configuration is specified in the Batch's definition.

```ruby
class ExampleBatch < ApplicationBatch
  with_sequential_processor
  processor_option :continue_after_exception, true
end
```

BatchProcessor comes with two standard processors: **Parallel** and **Sequential**.

#### Parallel Processor

![parallel](docs/images/parallel-processor.png)

The Parallel Processor enqueues jobs to be performed later.

#### Sequential Processor

![sequential](docs/images/sequential-processor.png)

The Sequential Processor uses `.perform_now` to procedurally process each job within the current thread.

##### Processor Options

| Name                       | Description                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `continue_after_exception` | If true, batch continues after job error.   |
| `sorted`*                  | If true, `#find_each` will **not** be used. |

üíÅ‚Äç Note: `find_each` is used when possible, which ignores `order`; the flag only forces `#each`.

### Jobs

BatchProcessor depends on ActiveJob for handling the processing of individual items in a collection.

Only a **BatchJob** can be used to perform work, but it can be run outside of a batch as well.
 
Therefore, the recommendation is to make `ApplicationJob` inherit from `BatchJob`.

The `rails g batch_processor:install` does this for you:

```ruby
class ApplicationJob < BatchProcessor::BatchJob; end
```

A BatchJob calls into the Batch to report on it's lifecycle from start to finish, including on success and failure.

#### Handling Errors

TODO

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes, `"weird stuff"` (this is a technical term) happens on the internet.

One example is a vanishing job:

- A job is picked off the queue and usually takes 18 seconds process.
- 5 seconds into performing, the worker received a `SIGTERM`.
- The worker, being Resque, decides to dirty exit instead of graceful shutdown.
- The job never completes, never is retried, never enters the queue again, and never reports status.
- The `running_jobs_count` of your batch and will contain a count that will never go down.
- Because one of the jobs has not reported in, the batch will never complete.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This kind of "weird stuff" can always happen, and at scale **WILL** always happen! Be prepared!

### Best Practice

Troubleshooting this issue will be very similar to troubleshooting any batch issues, but no two issues are fully alike.

What follows is therefore the generic "best practice" for handling any class of batch issue.

1. Abort the Batch. This stops any new batches from processing and allows any enqueued jobs to flush from the workers.
2. Damage Report. Figure out what went wrong and what needs to be cleaned up. 
3. Cleanup Fallout. Perform all the cleanup as determined in step 2.
4. Wait. Allow time for the workers to chew through and cancel the pending jobs in your aborted batch.
5. Clear the Batch. Manually flush any lost jobs, forcing the batch to run it's completion events.

**Abort the Batch**

```ruby
batch = ApplicationBatch.find(batch_id)
batch.abort!
```

**Damage Report**

üí° **Note**: By the nature of async processing your jobs can (and likely will, given enough workers) fail at every line:

```ruby
class ExampleJob < ApplicationJob
  def perform(order)
    raise NotProcessing unless order.payment_processing?
    
    order.mark_charge_starting!
    
    charge_service = ChargeService.new(order)
    charge_result = result.charge!
    
    if result.success?
      result.mark_charge_success!
    else
      result.mark_payment_failed!
    end
  end
end
```

In this example, if you had say, 30 workers processing your batch, you could expect to see the following issues:

- Orders which were taken off the queue, marked as running, and then never passed the guard clause.
- Orders which were marked that the charge was starting, but the service was never instantiated.
- üò± Orders which were submitted and a customer's money was taken, but your application has no record of that!
- Orders submitted and a customer did not have funds available, but the application has no record of that EITHER!!
- We get the response, but are not capable of reporting success about the charge in the database.
- We actually record success in the database but the job cannot report itself as having completed to the batch!

üíÅ‚Äç **The Rule of Law**: For every `N` lines of code in your job, you create `N+2` **at least** unique problems. üò¨
 
### Aborting

![aborting](docs/images/aborting.png)

Batches can be **Aborted**.

```ruby
batch = ApplicationBatch.find(some_batch_id)
batch.abort!
```

When aborted, processing will continue on enqueued jobs but **jobs will not be performed**.

This is overall less disruptive (and much easier) than manually removing enqueued ActiveJobs.

When perform is skipped because of an aborted batch, the job reports itself as **canceled**.

```ruby
batch = ApplicationBatch.find(some_batch_id)
details = batch.details

details.performed_jobs_count # => 7
details.performed_jobs_count # => 8
details.canceled_jobs_count # => 0

batch.abort!

details.performed_jobs_count # => 8
details.canceled_jobs_count # => 1
details.canceled_jobs_count # => 2
```

üí° **Note**: Aborting only prevents new jobs from being performed. Running jobs will complete normally if `#abort!` was called after they began to process.

#### Clearing

Because clearing is a manual process only to be used in exceptional circumstances, it **requires** the batch be aborted.

In these cases, after a developer intervenes to assess the impact of the failure, the batch can be manually cleared.

```ruby
batch = ApplicationBatch.find(some_batch_id)
details = batch.details

details.size # => 10
details.pending_jobs_count # => 2
details.running_jobs_count # => 2
details.finished_jobs_count # => 6
details.cleared_jobs_count # => 0

details.clear!

details.running_jobs_count # => 0
details.pending_jobs_count # => 0
details.cleared_jobs_count # => 4
```

üí° **Note**: Calling `#clear!` on a batch will trigger the batch completion events and finish the batch.

There is no use case to `#clear!` an in-flight batch and doing so is incredibly disruptive and corrupt the counts.
